🧠 First, what is the goal?
When a user logs in successfully, we need to keep them "logged in" across different requests (pages).
HTTP is stateless — it forgets users between requests — so we need sessions to remember who is logged in.

But storing the entire user object in the session would be too heavy (imagine full name, password hash, etc.).
Instead, we store just a little unique piece of info, like the user ID.

That's where serialize and deserialize come in!

🔹 passport.serializeUser(user, done)
After a user successfully logs in, Passport calls serializeUser.

You decide what part of the user object you want to store in the session.

Commonly, it's the user._id.

✅ For example:

javascript
Copy
Edit
passport.serializeUser(function(user, done) {
  done(null, user.id); // save only the user id into the session
});
Meaning:

"From now on, for this logged-in user, save just their id in the session."

🔹 passport.deserializeUser(id, done)
When a request comes in, Passport reads the id from the session and calls deserializeUser.

Now you use that id to fetch the full user from the database again.

Then you attach that full user object to req.user, so you can use req.user anywhere in your route handlers.

✅ For example:

javascript
Copy
Edit
passport.deserializeUser(function(id, done) {
  User.findById(id, function(err, user) {
    done(err, user);
  });
});
Meaning:

"Hey, a request came from someone with user.id = X. Let's look up the full user from the database and attach it to the request."

🛜 Visual Mini-Flow:
rust
Copy
Edit
User logs in --> Passport authenticates --> serializeUser saves user.id to session

Later:

User sends another request --> Session contains user.id --> deserializeUser finds full user --> req.user available
⚡ In your case:
Since you use:

javascript
Copy
Edit
passport.serializeUser(User.serializeUser());
passport.deserializeUser(User.deserializeUser());
You're using Passport-Local-Mongoose's helper methods — it automatically sets up the serialize/deserialize behavior for you behind the scenes, based on user IDs. (It saves you from writing that manual code.)

Summary:


Function	When it runs	Purpose
serializeUser	After successful login	Store small info (usually ID) into the session.
deserializeUser	On every incoming request	Fetch full user from DB using ID from session.
Would you also like me to show you a small code timeline of a user logging in and making two requests, showing when exactly serialize and deserialize happen? 📜 It can make it super intuitive!


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

🔹 passport.isAuthenticated() checks:

"Is there a valid user session attached to this request?"

If yes → user can proceed.
If no → user gets redirected to login (or denied access, based on how you handle it).

🔹 When a user logs in successfully (through Passport's passport.authenticate()),
Passport creates a session for that user, usually stored in the server memory, Redis, MongoDB, etc.

Inside that session, it stores the user's ID (or whatever you set during serializeUser).

🔹 Now, on every new request (e.g., to /create, /delete, /update, etc.):

Passport reads the session cookie from the browser.

It deserializes the user (using your deserializeUser() function).

It checks if the user is authenticated.

If authenticated, req.isAuthenticated() returns true.

🔥 So YES:
User logs in once ✅

Session cookie is stored in browser ✅

For every protected route (like /create, /delete), your isAuthenticated middleware will automatically check if the user is logged in ✅

No need to login again and again until:

User logs out OR

Session expires OR

Cookie is cleared.

Example Code:
javascript
Copy
Edit
function isLoggedIn(req, res, next) {
    if (req.isAuthenticated()) {
        return next();
    }
    res.redirect('/login'); // or send an error
}

// Using it as middleware
app.post('/create', isLoggedIn, (req, res) => {
    // Your create logic
});

app.delete('/delete/:id', isLoggedIn, (req, res) => {
    // Your delete logic
});
Small Tip:
If you want the session to last longer (so user doesn't get logged out quickly), you can set options like:

javascript
Copy
Edit
app.use(session({
    secret: 'yourSecret',
    resave: false,
    saveUninitialized: false,
    cookie: { maxAge: 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000 } // cookie valid for 1 day
}));

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Logging someone in = Server side action (not an immediate visible response).

So,
req.login(user) → means
"Dear server, please attach this user to the current request's session."
(not sending anything yet to client)

After login succeeds, then you send a response:

javascript
Copy
Edit
res.redirect("/listings");  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

First: How req.originalUrl works
req.originalUrl stores the URL of the current request the user made.

It is captured only when that request is happening.

In your case:
When you click on the image (<a href="/listings/abc123">), your browser sends a GET request to /listings/abc123.

At that moment, req.originalUrl is /listings/abc123.

But...

If you are already logged in, great, the server shows you that listing.

If you are not logged in, and you have isLoggedIn middleware protecting that route, it redirects you to /login and stores /listings/abc123 into session/local for after login redirection.

✅ This is what you expect, and it's correct.

Problem is:
If you click on the link (image) ➔ go to /listings/abc123 ➔ and that route is not protected (i.e., does NOT use isLoggedIn middleware), then:

No redirectUrl is captured, because there's no protection check forcing login.

When you then login separately by clicking "Login", there is no original URL to redirect back to — because the login page request (/login) is what is setting originalUrl now (which is just /login, useless).

✅ Thus, unless you protect the /listings/:id route with isLoggedIn, your app won't capture that original clicked link for redirection after login.

In very simple words:

Scenario	Will the originalUrl work?
Click on image ➔ listing route is protected by isLoggedIn ➔ forced login ➔ Yes, redirected back correctly after login	✅
Click on image ➔ listing route is not protected ➔ manually click login ➔ originalUrl is /login ➔ No, no redirection to listing	❌
Solutions for this
You have 2 options to solve this:

Protect /listings/:id and similar routes using isLoggedIn middleware.

javascript
Copy
Edit
app.get('/listings/:id', isLoggedIn, async (req, res) => {
    // your controller logic
});
This way, when user clicks the listing link, if not logged in, they'll be redirected to login, and originalUrl will correctly be /listings/abc123.

More Advanced (for public pages only):
If you want to allow viewing listings without login but still capture user's last visited page,
you can manually store the originalUrl yourself whenever any interesting link is clicked.

Example middleware:

javascript
Copy
Edit
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  if (!req.isAuthenticated() && req.method === "GET" && !req.path.startsWith("/login") && !req.path.startsWith("/signup")) {
    req.session.redirectUrl = req.originalUrl;
  }
  next();
});
This stores any GET request as the redirectUrl in session if the user is not logged in — even if the page is public.

✅ Now even if listings are public, you will redirect them back after login!
